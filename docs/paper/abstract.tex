VANETs provide a new way of transmitting information, particularly for safety for drivers and vehicles on the road. This also comes with challenges of ensuring authorship of data, need for secure communication, in a highly dynamic network topology whose members are mostly ephemeral. This paper details these challenges and how block chain technologies can be leveraged to address these concerns.
