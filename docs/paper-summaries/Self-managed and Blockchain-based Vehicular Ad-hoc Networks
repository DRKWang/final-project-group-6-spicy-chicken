Intro:
------
* Most common VANETs have been government controlled.
* Need for decentralized and non-government surveillant services.
* Ethereum's contract system can provide a framework for self-organized
    and self-managed network for distributed applications built on
    blockchain technology.

VANETs:
--------
* Simple description of VANETs. Read "_Terms" post in github

Ethereum:
---------
* Ethereum uses a "Turing-complete programming language" for its contracts.
* Contracts run on the blockchain and consist of:
    * program code, storage, and an account balance.
    * created by posting them to the blockchain.
    * run when it receives a message from a user or triggered by another 
        contract.
    * can also receive or send money to other contracts or users.
    * can use the storage 
* Execution of contract code is "...part of the block validation algorithm",
    so if a transaction is added, the code execution spawned by that    
    transaction is executed by all nodes.


Self-Managed VANETs:
--------------------
* RSUs are not only for communication relay station, they also run the
    applications deployed to Ethereum blockchain.
* Users can subscribe to certain provided applications by the RSU.
* (See Fig. 2 for subscription process)
* Each network participant has an Ethereum address (hash of the public key)
* Each message/transaction that uses Ethereum application requires
    Ethereum-gas, an internal pricing for running a transaction or contract.
* These funds would pay for required infrastructure costs.
* Applications enforce rules or provide services, thus regulates itself.
* Taxes collected would incentivize people to provide for the RSUs, since 
    mining costs 

Conclusion:
-----------
* Ethereum's smart contract system allows to run applications on the 
    blockchain. 
* This allows for self-managed and decentralized network operation.
* The paper proposes some mandatory applications, like traffic regulation,
    vehicle tax and insurance, as well as optional applications which can 
     be subscribed to.
