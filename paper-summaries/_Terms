VANETs: 
-------
Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a subclass of mobile ad hoc networks 
(MANETs) where it is developed by moving vehicles [35]. VANET is getting 
progressively well known in rush hour gridlock administration particularly 
in a portion of the created nations.

IEEE 802.11p:
-------------
IEEE 802.11p is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard to add 
wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), a vehicular communication 
system. It defines enhancements to 802.11 (the basis of products marketed as 
Wi-Fi) required to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 
applications. This includes data exchange between high-speed vehicles and 
between the vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, so called V2X 
communication, in the licensed ITS band of 5.9 GHz

WAVE:
-----
The IEEE 1609 Family of Standards for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments
(WAVE) defines the architecture, communications model, management structure,
security mechanisms and physical access for high speed (up to 27 Mb/s) short
range (up to 1000m) low latency wireless communications in the vehicular
environment. The primary architectural components defined by these standards are
the On Board Unit (OBU), Road Side Unit (RSU) and WAVE interface.
