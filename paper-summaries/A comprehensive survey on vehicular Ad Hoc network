VANETs: 
-------
Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a subclass of mobile ad hoc networks 
(MANETs) where it is developed by moving vehicles [35]. VANET is getting 
progressively well known in rush hour gridlock administration particularly 
in a portion of the created nations.

IEEE 802.11p:
-------------
IEEE 802.11p is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard to add 
wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), a vehicular communication 
system. It defines enhancements to 802.11 (the basis of products marketed as 
Wi-Fi) required to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 
applications. This includes data exchange between high-speed vehicles and 
between the vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, so called V2X 
communication, in the licensed ITS band of 5.9 GHz
ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11p

WAVE:
-----
The IEEE 1609 Family of Standards for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments
(WAVE) defines the architecture, communications model, management structure,
security mechanisms and physical access for high speed (up to 27 Mb/s) short
range (up to 1000m) low latency wireless communications in the vehicular
environment. The primary architectural components defined by these standards are
the On Board Unit (OBU), Road Side Unit (RSU) and WAVE interface.

Terms:
AU: Application Unit
OBU: On-board unit
RSU: Roadside Unit

1. Intro:
---------
* provide wireless communication via DSRC and IEEE802.11p
* allows Vehicle to Vehicle communication (V2V) or to Road side unit (RSU)
* 1609 wireless standards (WAVE) 
* can share different info: safety, accident prevention, traffic jams,
    post-accident investigation, non-safety info.
* Research covers: communication, networking, routing

2. VANET Architechture:
-----------------------
* RSU hosts application provides services
* OBU is a peer device that uses services
* Each vehicle has an OBU, collects dat via sensors and sends it to RSUs or
    other vehicles, and has atleast one AU.
* RSU can connect to internet if needed.

2.1 OBU (On-Board Unit):
------------------------
* Main function is wireless radio access, ad hoc and geographical routing,
    network congestion control, reliable message transfer, data security,
    and IP mobility.
* Contains Resource Command processor (RCP), which reads/writes memory.
    also a user-interface, interface to connect to other OBUs

2.2 AU (Application Unit):
--------------------------
* Application can be dedicated device or generic device (like PDA)
* Connects exclusively to OBU via wired/wireless.

2.3 RSU (Road side Unit):
-------------------------
* WAVE device fixed along the road side or in dedicated locations 
    (like junction or parking spaces)
* Equipped with device (usually IEEE 802.11p radio device)
1. It can extend communication range of ad-hoc network by "hopping" via other
    OBUs to forward to desired recipient.
2. Provide safety information like (low bridge warning esp for truckers),
    accident warning, or work zone or use infrastructure to vehicle (I2V)
    communication, and acting as an information source.
3. Provide internet connectivity to other OBUs.

3. VANET communications:
-------------------------
Communication between vehicles and RSU/infrastructure are 3 types:
1. In-Vehicle-domain:
  * OBU and 1+ AUs. OBU simply provides the communication link to AU.
2. Ad hoc domain:
  * Vehicles with OBUs and a RSU along the roadside.
  a. 
    * allows for fully decentralized and distributed communication between
      vehicles.
    * either V2V if route available, else multi-hop to destination
    * ITS (Intervehicle communication): popular in US, EU and Japan
  b.
    * Vehicle communicates with RSU to increase range, by sending or
      forwarding data. 
    * allows for V2I (vehicle to infrastructure) communication
3. Infrastructure domain:
   * RSU can connect to infrastructural networks or the Internet.
   * AUs registered can communicate with Internet based host
   * OBUs can communicate with other hosts for non-safety applications
     using cellular radio networks (GSM, GPRS, UMTS, HSDPA, WiMax and 4G)

4. Wireless access tech in VANET:
---------------------------------
* TODO: [Expand this section as needed)
* Many wireless access tech available:
    1. Cellular Systems (2/2.5/2.75/3G)
    2. WLAN/WiFi
    3. WiMax
    4. DSRC/WAVE
    5. Combined:
        * CALM M5: Continuous air interface for medium and long range.
        * incorporates other wireless tech.

5. VANET Characteristics:
-------------------------
* Has unique characteristics that can be leveraged 
1. Predictive Mobility:
    * Different than other mobile networks, because nodes do not move in
      a random way. Because vehicles follow road topology and layout.
      => very Predictive mobility
2. Providing safe driving:
    * Can provide drivers travelling in the same directions with info:
        * warning messages about accidents
        * need for sudden, hard breaking
        * apprise the driver of broader picture of the road aheah.
        * traffic flow, weather
        * POI (point of interest) info; like malls, gas station, food
3. No power constraints:
    * Power is provided by the vehicle, so not limited by power consumption.
4. Variable network density:
    * Network density depends on traffic flow, therefore care must be taken.
5. Rapid changes in network topology:
    * Lifetime link between nodes/vehicles is affected by direction of travel.
    * Lifetime link between Vehicles in opposite direction is short.
    * Expect small diameter in link connectivity.
6. Large scale network:
    * Urban areas have dense networks vs rural areas.
7. High Computational ability:
    * Can do local computation before transmission.
    * ex: large set of sensors, big processor, large memory, antennae
    * Perhaps even ML???

6. Challenges and requirements in VANET:
----------------------------------------
* Signal fading:
    * Objects in between endpoints can affect the efficiency.
    * ex: obstacles on road, buildings in urban areas
* Bandwidth Limitations:
    * Since no central coordinator, there's a high chance of congestion
    * Need to use bandwidth wisely.
    * If vehicle no way to transmist, then wait and resend, instead of 
        repeated retries.
* Connectivity:
    * Changing topology will lead to frequent fragmentation in networks.
    * Could increase transmission power, but can lead to degradation
* Small effective diameter:
    * No way to maintain global topology of the network.
* Security and Privacy:
    * In mesh type networks, relay-er will know sender and reciepient.
* Routing Protocol:
    * Given high mobility of nodes, and rapid changing topology, we need
        efficient routing protocol.
    * Goal 1: Improve percentage of packet delivery
    * Goal 2: Reduce interference caused by high buildings
    * Goal 3: Consider how to scale
    * Goal 4: Shortest deliver time for Emergency situations

7. VANET Applications:
