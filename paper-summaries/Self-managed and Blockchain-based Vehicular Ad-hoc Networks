Intro:
------
* Most common VANETs have been government controlled.
* Need for decentralized and non-government surveillant services.
* Ethereum's contract system can provide a framework for self-organized
    and self-managed network for distributed applications built on
    blockchain technology.

VANETs:
--------
* Simple description of VANETs. Read "_Terms" post in github

Ethereum:
---------
* Ethereum uses a "Turing-complete programming language" for its contracts.
* Contracts run on the blockchain and consist of:
    * program code, storage, and an account balance.
    * created by posting them to the blockchain.
    * run when it receives a message from a user or triggered by another 
        contract.
    * can also receive or send money to other contracts or users.
    * can use the storage 
* Execution of contract code is "...part of the block validation algorithm",
    so if a transaction is added, the code execution spawned by that    
    transaction is executed by all nodes.
