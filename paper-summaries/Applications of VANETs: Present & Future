1. Intro:
---------
* Since 43000 deaths/year = 2.7 million injured = $230billion social cost,
    need to address it.
* DSRC and IEEE 802.11p WAVE approved for MAC an PHY layers

2. Characteristics of Vanets:
-----------------------------
* a. Highly dynamic topology:
    * High speed of vehicles, and multiple paths to endpoints
* b. Frequent disconnect network:
    * Variable speed of vehicles also means frequent disconnects, esp from
        Road Side Units (RSUs)
* c. Mobility modeling and Prediction:
    * Because of roadmap, we can somewhat predict vehicles for efficient
        network design.
* d. Communication Environment:
    * Accounting for terrain, architecture, highways, climate, urban/city
        factors that can disrupt communications
* e. Hard Delay Constraints:
    * Account for emergency signals that have a priority and deadline.
* f. Interaction with onboard sensors:
    * Sensors can give velocity, direction which can be used in link and 
        routing as informtion for the protocols built on top of it.
* g. Unlimited battery power and storage:
    * Unlike other mobile computing implementations, since VANETs are in a car
        they can assume a stead power supply and storage.

3. Applications of VANETs:
--------------------------
* RSU can be treated as an access point or router or even a buffer.
* a. Safety oriented
    * I.   Real-time traffic
    * II.  Co-operative Message tranfer
    * III. Post Crash Notification
    * IV.  Road Hazard Control Notification
    * V.   Cooperative Collision Warning
    * VI.  Traffic Vigilance
* b. Commercial oriented
    * I.   Remote Vehicle Personalization/Diagnostics
    * II.  Internet Access.
* c. Convenience oriented
    * I.   Route Diversions:
            * Route planning
    * II.  Electronic toll collection
    * III. Parking Availability
    * IV.  Active Prediction

* d. Productive oriented
    * I.   Environmental Benefits:
        * AERIS generates environmental relevant data to make better future
            choices.
    * II.  Time Utilization:
        * Use internet
    * III. Fuel Saving:
        * Toll can waste 3% of fuel by stopping for 2-5 minutes.
